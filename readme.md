#### release notes for version 2.0 (August 2016)
- moved function `compute_attractors_tarjan` from module STGs to module AttractorDetection
- split functions `check_primes` and `check_smv` into three functions each for _counterexamples_ and _acceptingstates_ to force control over return values
- removed feature `add_style_condensationgraph` from module STGs
- bugfix for the computation of the condensation graph
- added the parameter `LayoutEngine` for drawing graphs. Possible engines: `dot,neato,fdp,sfdp,circo` and `twopi`
- added functions for the `sccgraph`, the `condensationgraph` and the `HTG`
- now following the git model described in [nvie.com](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
- refactored `Utility.py` in `Utility\DiGraphs.py` and `Utility\Miscellaneous.py`
- added documentation source to `Docs\Sphinx`
- added `AttractorBasins.py`, a library for visualizing basins of attraction
- added support for model checking with _accepting states_ via [NuSMV-a](https://github.com/hklarner/NuSMV-a)
- added `Examples/`, a folder with pre-defined networks
- added support for Python 2.x _and_ 3.x
- added function `input_combinations` to module `PrimeImplicants`
